        <div><b>Lesson 1: Welcome to the Nanodegree</b></div>
        <div>
            <p>Setting Up: Set up your text editor
            (Atom, Pycharm, etc) (2)</p>
            <p>Thinking Like a Programmer:<p><img src="ThinkingLikeAProgrammer.jpg" alt="
                Procedural Thinking, Abstract Thinking, Systems Thinking,
                Technological Empathy, and Systematic
                Debugging">(6)</p>
            <p>- Procedural Thinking: Creating unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow</p>
            <p>- Abstract Thinking: Finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst
                seemingly different things. For example, in this Nanodegree you will visit hundreds of
                Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each
                of these pages individually.</p>
            <p>- Systems Thinking: Breaking a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this
                when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work.</p>
            <p>- Technological Empathy: "Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example,
                computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and
                what it's good and bad at doing.</p>
            <p>- Debugging: A systematic process of identifying the cause
                of a computer program that doesn't work. (7)</p>

        </div>
        <div><p>Support from the Udacity Team:</p>
            <p>- Slack Community: This platform allows students to quickly chat about issues in any of
                the course material as well as offer help to stuck classmates.</p>
            <p>- Forums</p>
            <p>- 1:1 Appointments: For more specific, coding-related questions, schedule a one-on-one
                appointment with a Coach by clickingon One-on-One Appointments in the Resources tab.

            <p>Integrity and Mindset: The Honor Code: "I hereby confirm
                that all of my project submissions consist of my own
                work. Accordingly, I will document and cite the
                origins of any part(s) of my project submissions
                that were taken from websites, books, forums, blog
                posts, github repositories, or any other source and
                explain why I used them for any part of my submission.
                I understand that I may be asked to explain my work in
                a video call with a Udacity Coach before my Nanodegree
                is conferred." (6)</p>

            On that note, I should mention my images in the document
            come from the Udacity course and this website:
            http://www.scriptingmaster.com/html/basic-structure-HTML
            -document.asp. I have the benefit of knowing a programmer
            who helped me set up Pycharm for use in this course
            and a QA expert who showed me this video: (NSFW)
            https://youtu.be/27dnddCq5gc, which is both hilarious and
            educational. It's how I figured out how to put images on
            my page. I also used this page on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions
            /6817262/how-to-display-html-tags-as-plain-text
            to figure out how to put html syntax on the page

            web is HTTP. Computers that host the files that make up the web are servers.
            The world's largest computer network is the internet. A program

        <p>Inline vs Block: Example: &lt;br&gt is inline whereas &lt;p&gt is a block.
            What &lt;p&gt does that's different from
            &lt;br&gt is it created an invisible box around it's
            contents. (13)</p>
        <p>Span and Div: &lt;span&gt is inline and &lt;div&gt is block.
            They don't do anything other than just contain their content and there's
            a way to attach styles to them, to adjust how they display.</p>
